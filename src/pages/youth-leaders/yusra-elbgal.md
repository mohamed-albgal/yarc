bio: "Yusra Elbgal was born and raised in Oakland, California mere minutes from
  the UC Berkeley campus. She had known from a young age that Cal was the place
  for her. Despite moving away in middle school, she maintained a connection to
  Berkeley and had her heart set on making it there. She persevered through high
  school, making sure to participate in as many extracurriculars as she could
  during school hours so she could go home and support her family. She was an
  active member of her Muslim and Yemeni community and was an advocate for their
  causes. When she graduated in 2019 and was accepted to her dream school, she
  took her passion for social justice with her.   Yusra is now a rising
  sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Political Economy and minoring in Arabic.
  Throughout her undergraduate career, she will be diving deep into the
  relationship between government, politics and the economy as a Political
  Economy major. Yusra is eager to use that knowledge to promote upward mobility
  in her Yemeni community. In the meantime, she has a newfound passion for
  promoting education as a tool of social justice. In her first year, she served
  on the Muslim Student Association’s Youth Outreach committee, worked at El
  Cerrito elementary schools, was a literacy tutor for the Ta’alam Literacy
  Program that fostered reading skills in Middle Eastern elementary students,
  and is now college mentor for West Contra Costa County youth. As she gears up
  for her second year, she joined the Yemeni American Youth Center as a Youth
  Leader and will be leading a college readiness program for Yemeni female high
  schoolers with the YAYC in the fall. "

I found it difficult in high school to balance my responsibilities at home with my school work and the pressure to stand out as a college applicant. My extracurricular activities couldn’t interfere with my chores at home and often my schoolwork came last. I did my best to do as many activities I could during school hours like student government, yearbook and the Muslim Student Assocation. I would then go straight home to take care of my responsibilities and at the end of the day I had to find the energy to finish my homework. 

I had to find the motivation within myself to persevere through systems that didn’t want me in professional or academic settings. The political, economic and cultural barriers I faced made me feel like the world was against me. I pushed through by relying on self motivation and empowerment from my community. I’ve learned the importance of using communal resources to your advantage and hope more people can realize it’s ok to ask for help. The Yemeni American Youth Center is a great resource to support you through your ambitions and even expand your horizons beyond what you thought was possible for yourself. I’m now on a mission to make college accessible to Yemeni girls by building a community of aspirational and self motivated Yemeniat. No cultural, political, or socioeconomic barrier should stand in the way a Yemenia’s right to education.
