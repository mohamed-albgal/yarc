My name is Bayan Muhammad Al-Badani. I am a senior student at Oakland International High school.

I am a member of the Youth Leadership Team at the Yemeni American Youth Center. I won first place in the Yemeni American Young Writers Contest in story writing. I am passionate about helping the Yemeni community here in the US, supporting them and advocating on behalf of them.

I love reading and writing, and I hope to develop my writing skills to become an author in the future. My dream is to attend Harvard University and I have been working so hard to achieve it. I am also trying hard to be active in the field of womenâ€™s rights, specially Muslim woman. As a newcomer to the US, one of the difficulties i am facing here is that English is my second language but i am putting great effort to learn and improve my reading, writing and speaking skills.
