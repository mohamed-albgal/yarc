bio: "Khatab is a recent high school graduate from San Francisco. He was born
  and raised in SF where he loved to do community work throughout the Bay Area.
  Khatab just finished his term as the first Yemeni American Youth Commissioner
  of San Francisco, appointed by Supervisor Matt Haney. During his term, Khatab
  was the Vice Chair of the Housing and Land Use Committee on the Youth
  Commission. Some of his accomplishments include pushing for a Transitional Age
  Youth Navigation Center for San Francisco Youth on the streets, Town Hall
  meeting with SFMTA on improving bus lines, and meeting with the director of
  SFMTA to urge him to include free MUNI for all youth of San Francisco with the
  eventual expansion to ages 18-24 for college students.  Khatab is now heading
  to UC Irvine where he will study political science with the hopes of becoming
  a lawyer in the near future. He plans on using his law degree to help those in
  his community that deserve justice and eventually become a political candidate
  and create permanent change that fights against the injustices that we see
  online and in the streets all the time. "

An issue that affects my community constantly is drug abuse and homelessness. I grew up watching people do all kinds of drugs and losing their families and homes because of it. I feel like this is an issue that doesn’t get touched on as much as it should because it’s only getting worse. I grew up knowing a lot of people in my community and we all saw the same stuff every day. As I grew older I started feeling disconnected from those people I knew because they would start to become drug addicts in the streets as teens. This is the kind of issue I want to solve in my life because at this rate the next generation is just going to be drug and alcohol abusers if they keep seeing more and more people becoming just that. 

If I were to become the Mayor or a member of the Board of Supervisors, I would then take action to create more awareness of this issue by becoming stricter on the buying and selling of drugs and alcohol. Alcohol especially, because I have seen corner stores be willing to sell to the youth just to make an extra dollar. I understand that the drugs may be harder to crack down on because it is mostly sold illegally but the best way to go against illegal drug organizations is to create an anti-drug organization. By that, I mean creating a program to help troubled kids in drug-affected communities. The organization would help kids in school and in life by helping out with job and internship applications. This would be a good way to keep the youth in a safer drug-free environment and show them how kids their age should be. They would be receiving help on school assignments from other student tutors and I would gladly be one of those tutors as well. 

The biggest challenge for this is engaging youth to come consistently but I would personally be willing to go out and find students who are willing to participate and help keep the youth engaged and coming back constantly. I feel like this would help give troubled kids a sense of balance in their lives because they would have something positive in a community that's full of temptations and bad influences. Just like I hated seeing my friends falling into drugs, I would hate it just as much if the next generation falls into the same traps.
