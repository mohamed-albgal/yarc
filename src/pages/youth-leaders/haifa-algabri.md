  community and always applying herself forward in pursuit of justice, a fire
  birthed to her by her Islamic faith.

My resume and transcript just gives you a glimpse of my grit and perseverance regardless of obstacles or hurdles that come my way. I am a double major working towards a B.S degree in Biopsychology and a B.A in Health Policy Analysis as a Pre-Med and student leader. I completed the 2019 Summer of Science Program at Mills and was accepted into the Jill Barrett Biology Research Program for the summer of 2020. Although I wasn’t accepted for Inside UCSF 2019 School of Medicine I still kept going to ensure that I am still knocking on that door with more refined keys. 

I applied to Inside UCSF 2020 School of Medicine, because a closed door from the past was not the end of the tunnel for me. Alhamdulilah, I got accepted into Inside UCSF 2020 School of Medicine, however the program was cancelled due to the novel coronavirus. Being admitted was an accomplishment I didn’t get to experience, which is why I will In Shaa Allah apply again for the 2021 cycle. I am passionate about Medicine because it’s what I want to apply my science knowledge in. Being a physician means I can be there for people and continue to learn science at the same time. I aspire to be an OB/GYN, because women's reproductive health has always been an interest of mine. It has always been the speciality that I wanted to work towards, however after losing another person to gun violence during sophomore year my interest has shifted to trauma care. This loss was definitely a turning point for me in the direction I am taking towards and within Medicine. When I say I want to be there for people as a physician it means that I am looking out for patients from disadvantaged communities in and out of the hospital. Anything I pursue must have community at its heart. I can’t imagine what I can become and accomplish for my community once I do become a physician In Shaa Allah. 

Coming from a disadvantaged background I did not have high quality education. In middle school I attended school in 3 different states one for each grade level. Each state had its own educational plan and pace. However, the experience with substitute teachers, locked doors, limited resources, and little to no opportunities were all the same. Due to this experience I lost my foundational skills in math that once made math my favorite subject. In high school, I continued to have the same barriers in middle school. The problem wasn’t the schools or education I had rather what they were housed in; institutionalized racism. I understood that education within communities of color and low income groups have been designed to dismantle our progress towards equality and equity. Unfortunately, my lack of math skills affected me greatly in college, but if I learned anything is that I will never give up on what I appreciate. I appreciate community, education, and I appreciate Medicine. The grind I have was born out of the struggle and the lens it gave me for my righteous indignation. I read and write poetry along with rap as a healing mechanism and to inspire change in others going through similar issues. One of my favorite lines that inspires me is “The rose that grew from concrete” by Tupac Shakur and the symbol of the Desert Rose. 

Culturally, I was raised to believe that my education is a favor bestowed upon me and not a right. However, I became a practicing Muslim in the 7th grade after I almost lost my father to a robbery and several gun shot wounds. As I embarked on my journey as a person of faith I began to challenge both American and Yemeni ideologies imposed on women. For instance, within my Yemeni culture women have to constantly explain why they even deserve to knock on a door of opportunity such as education, school, or Medicine. I was raised to believe that a woman is to never challenge a man, but it is now something that I do in a heartbeat. Being a man is not an excuse to take up space meant for women and to enforce your masculinity on. I have my faith to thank and appreciate as all my empowerment and source of strength is through it.
