#Blog Post 2

Our Goals Are Broken Down into 3:
- Provide support
- Offer mentorship
- Be enablers for a cohesive community

Human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it 
is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or 
desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from 
it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no 
annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
