**Story**

When it comes to challenges youth face in the academic field, I can attest to how difficult it can be for students to transition from high school to college or from college to university. The transitioning process can be stressful and overwhelming. I know it was for me 4 years ago. I remember that it was challenging because I did not reach out for help. I did not take advantage of the resources surrounding me and there were so many. I thought I was independent enough. So I worked a lot and paid for my classes, books, parking, and everything without realizing that I could have gotten help for it. I did that for my first year in college. My second year however, I started networking and learning more about the different services, programs, and resources the school offered students. I simply started asking more questions. I applied for financial aid, I applied for multiple scholarships, I reached out to my professors to write me recommendation letters, and I just kept learning more and more about how I can be resourceful. My second year was great. I did not have to worry about anything else besides my academics, which is how it’s supposed to be.

The resources are out there, you just need to do your part as the student and utilize them. I wish I knew then what I know now. It would have made my first year much easier and less stressful. But I didn’t. I didn’t know better. And that’s why I want the youth of the Yemeni community to know better and do better so that we can move forward, rather than remain stagnant.

As a member of the Youth Leadership Team, and as a certified College English Reading and Writing Tutor, I extend my help to the Yemeni youth. I am prepared to assist high school and college students complete their college applications, edit their personal insight questions, help create their resumes and more.

This center, and this youth leadership program, is a resource and a tool for the youth to utilize. This time the resource is reaching out to the youth, offering help. We urge the youth to take advantage of this resource as much as possible. We want to hear from you all with any concerns, questions, ideas, feedback, or suggestions. We encourage you to contact the Yemeni American Youth Center and use this platform to simply express what you’re thinking without any restraints and without any limitations.



## Yusra Elbgal

**Biography**

was born and raised in Oakland, California mere minutes from the UC Berkeley campus. She had known from a young age that Cal was the place for her. Despite moving away in middle school, she maintained a connection to Berkeley and had her heart set on making it there. She persevered through high school, making sure to participate in as many extracurriculars as she could during school hours so she could go home and support her family. She was an active member of her Muslim and Yemeni community and was an advocate for their causes. When she graduated in 2019 and was accepted to her dream school, she took her passion for social justice with her.

Yusra is now a rising sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Political Economy and minoring in Arabic. Throughout her undergraduate career, she will be diving deep into the relationship between government, politics and the economy as a Political Economy major. Yusra is eager to use that knowledge to promote upward mobility in her Yemeni community. In the meantime, she has a newfound passion for promoting education as a tool of social justice. In her first year, she served on the Muslim Student Association’s Youth Outreach committee, worked at El Cerrito elementary schools, was a literacy tutor for the Ta’alam Literacy Program that fostered reading skills in Middle Eastern elementary students, and is now college mentor for West Contra Costa County youth. As she gears up for her second year, she joined the Yemeni American Youth Center as a Youth Leader and will be leading a college readiness program for Yemeni female high schoolers with the YAYC in the fall.

Story**

I found it difficult in high school to balance my responsibilities at home with my school work and the pressure to stand out as a college applicant. My extracurricular activities couldn’t interfere with my chores at home and often my schoolwork came last. I did my best to do as many activities I could during school hours like student government, yearbook and the Muslim Student Assocation. I would then go straight home to take care of my responsibilities and at the end of the day I had to find the energy to finish my homework.

I had to find the motivation within myself to persevere through systems that didn’t want me in professional or academic settings. The political, economic and cultural barriers I faced made me feel like the world was against me. I pushed through by relying on self motivation and empowerment from my community. I’ve learned the importance of using communal resources to your advantage and hope more people can realize it’s ok to ask for help. The Yemeni American Youth Center is a great resource to support you through your ambitions and even expand your horizons beyond what you thought was possible for yourself. I’m now on a mission to make college accessible to Yemeni girls by building a community of aspirational and self motivated Yemeniat. No cultural, political, or socioeconomic barrier should stand in the way a Yemenia’s right to education.



## Haifa Algabri

**Biography**

Haifa Algabri is a rising junior at Mills College pursuing a B.S degree in Biopsychology and a B.A in Health Policy Analysis as a Pre-Medical student. She graduated from McClymonds High school, a place she considers home and the site of her character development for social justice and active change. As a full time student, Haifa is the President of the Muslim Student Alliance club, Co-Founder of the Pre-Health Track club, former book selection committee member, the Center for Transformative Action (CTA) program assistant, South Asian Middle Eastern Pacific Islander (SAMEAPI) board member, and a Health Advocate of Alameda Health System. She’s currently working in the Jill Barrett Biology Research Program at Mills, while being a Youth Leadership member for the newly organized Yemeni American Youth Center.

Through her work with Great School Choice, Haifa addressed and changed a discriminatory policy at Oakland Technical High School towards Muslim women & Yemeni women who did not wish to swim alongside men. She published several of her writings in the Womanist Journal, Campanil, Great School Choice, Education Post, & Energy Convertors. Within the classrooms, Haifa keeps a vigilant eye for justice whether it be calling out racism or decolonizing education by helping inspire a grant in the Psychology Department to develop course curriculum more inclusive towards People of Color. For Haifa, what grants her happiness is investing in her community and always applying herself forward in pursuit of justice, a fire birthed to her by her Islamic faith.

Personal Statement: My resume and transcript just gives you a glimpse of my grit and perseverance regardless of obstacles or hurdles that come my way. I am a double major working towards a B.S degree in Biopsychology and a B.A in Health Policy Analysis as a Pre-Med and student leader. I completed the 2019 Summer of Science Program at Mills and was accepted into the Jill Barrett Biology Research Program for the summer of 2020. Although I wasn’t accepted for Inside UCSF 2019 School of Medicine I still kept going to ensure that I am still knocking on that door with more refined keys.

I applied to Inside UCSF 2020 School of Medicine, because a closed door from the past was not the end of the tunnel for me. Alhamdulilah, I got accepted into Inside UCSF 2020 School of Medicine, however the program was cancelled due to the novel coronavirus. Being admitted was an accomplishment I didn’t get to experience, which is why I will In Shaa Allah apply again for the 2021 cycle. I am passionate about Medicine because it’s what I want to apply my science knowledge in. Being a physician means I can be there for people and continue to learn science at the same time. I aspire to be an OB/GYN, because women's reproductive health has always been an interest of mine. It has always been the speciality that I wanted to work towards, however after losing another person to gun violence during sophomore year my interest has shifted to trauma care. This loss was definitely a turning point for me in the direction I am taking towards and within Medicine. When I say I want to be there for people as a physician it means that I am looking out for patients from disadvantaged communities in and out of the hospital. Anything I pursue must have community at its heart. I can’t imagine what I can become and accomplish for my community once I do become a physician In Shaa Allah.

Coming from a disadvantaged background I did not have high quality education. In middle school I attended school in 3 different states one for each grade level. Each state had its own educational plan and pace. However, the experience with substitute teachers, locked doors, limited resources, and little to no opportunities were all the same. Due to this experience I lost my foundational skills in math that once made math my favorite subject. In high school, I continued to have the same barriers in middle school. The problem wasn’t the schools or education I had rather what they were housed in; institutionalized racism. I understood that education within communities of color and low income groups have been designed to dismantle our progress towards equality and equity. Unfortunately, my lack of math skills affected me greatly in college, but if I learned anything is that I will never give up on what I appreciate. I appreciate community, education, and I appreciate Medicine. The grind I have was born out of the struggle and the lens it gave me for my righteous indignation. I read and write poetry along with rap as a healing mechanism and to inspire change in others going through similar issues. One of my favorite lines that inspires me is “The rose that grew from concrete” by Tupac Shakur and the symbol of the Desert Rose.

Culturally, I was raised to believe that my education is a favor bestowed upon me and not a right. However, I became a practicing Muslim in the 7th grade after I almost lost my father to a robbery and several gun shot wounds. As I embarked on my journey as a person of faith I began to challenge both American and Yemeni ideologies imposed on women. For instance, within my Yemeni culture women have to constantly explain why they even deserve to knock on a door of opportunity such as education, school, or Medicine. I was raised to believe that a woman is to never challenge a man, but it is now something that I do in a heartbeat. Being a man is not an excuse to take up space meant for women and to enforce your masculinity on. I have my faith to thank and appreciate as all my empowerment and source of strength is through it.

**Story** 

If my life were a quote it would be “if it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you.” I believe that if you're ever too comfortable with what it is you are doing then it either means one of two things: you're not doing it right or the work is too easy. Luckily being an immigrant and a Muslim who faces the repercussions of 9/11 will always come with challenges.

Islam teaches me to be humble and modest which is why I won’t be sharing any of my struggles or accomplishments. However, I can say that being an immigrant comes with a package of challenges. The challenge of reaching for success while multitasking work, school, friends, and family is something many, including myself, must face. We face pressure everywhere, such as trying to achieve the American dream or trying to do right by our parents who have risked everything they had for our happiness.

You’d think that living in America would be easy, but the truth is as soon as you overcome adversity, it doesn’t matter where you are, there will always be another one. The acceptance of the fact has been my source of motivation whenever put into a difficult situation.

Currently, my heart pours for our Muslim nations. Nations such as Syria, Palestine, Yemen, and Iraq are in turmoil. Other countries such as China and France who oppress Muslims by keeping them in concentration camps and banning headscarves. My aspiration is to speak out against any injustices I encounter. Currently, I am working on a fundraiser that will aid deprived neighborhoods in Sana, Yemen with clean fresh water, food, and packages for families suffering from famine. I plan on working closely with our city leaders soon speaking out against the media. I am constantly reminded how our news outlets are failing Middle Eastern counties by not reporting what is happening, however, little to no action has been done. I will not stop until we are represented fairly and till the whole world knows the truth about where we come from
